Coursera Backend Dev Capstone

The assignment did not specify requiring any HTML files, so I only included the Home page and an additional 'Links' page. The links page has useful links for testing the app, instead of having to type the URLs. (http://localhost:8000/links)

There is also a text file, logins_notes.txt, with the superuser info.
